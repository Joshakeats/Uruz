### How Can You Contribute? (Focusing on Prototype Development)

To get the Uruzfrom concept to a tangible prototype, we're currently prioritizing contributions in these core areas:

- Conceptual & Detailed Design: If you're skilled in CAD software or mechanical design, we need help translating biomimetic principles into precise digital models for the skeletal structure, nitinol muscle configurations, and fluidic pathways. This includes exploring different joint mechanisms and attachment points.

- Medical & Physiological Expertise: Professionals with medical backgrounds, physiologists, and anatomists are highly welcome. Your insights into human physiology, biomechanics, long-term prosthetic integration, patient care, and clinical considerations are invaluable for ensuring safety, function, and comfort.

- Materials Science Research: Expertise in nitinol characteristics, colloidal gels (especially copper-mineral oil and copper-silicone compounds), and advanced skin materials is crucial. We need to identify specific formulations, manufacturing methods, and their precise properties for optimal performance.

- Simulation & Modeling: Contributions in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for structural integrity, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for thermal management, and AI model simulation are vital to validate designs and predict performance before physical fabrication.

- Sensor Integration & Signal Processing: Designing and simulating the integration of miniature thermal sensors and the sonic lattice within the "skin" layers, and developing preliminary algorithms for processing these complex sensory inputs.

- Artificial Intelligence (Conceptual & Algorithmic): While full AI development is long-term, contributions here could involve outlining control algorithms for nitinol actuation, initial approaches to user intent recognition, and early safety mechanism logic.

- Artistic Design & Aesthetics: Skilled artists, sculptors, and industrial designers are essential. Your eye for form, proportion, biomimetic aesthetics, and ergonomic elegance will ensure the Cyberlimb is not only functional but also a beautiful, intuitive, and personally integrating extension of the user.

As an Open Source project, we wholeheartedly welcome new ideas, insights, and contributions from all sources. However, please know that all proposed contributions and ideas will be subject to a peer-review process to ensure the scientific rigor, engineering viability, and overall quality of the Cyberlimb's development.

- Code of Conduct: To ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone, we ask all contributors to adhere to our Code of Conduct. Please read it before contributing.

- Reporting Issues or Bugs: If you find a bug or an issue with the Cyberlimb concept or documentation, please open a new issue on our GitHub Issues page. Before opening a new issue, please search existing ones to avoid duplicates.

- Proposing New Features or Ideas: Have a brilliant idea or a new concept you'd like to propose? We encourage you to open a new discussion on our GitHub Discussions page (or create an issue if it's a specific, actionable feature). This allows for open brainstorming and feedback.

- Submitting Changes (Pull Requests): For making actual changes to the documentation, design files, or code (when applicable), we follow a standard Pull Request (PR) workflow:

- Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
- Create a new branch for your changes.
- Make your changes (e.g., update documentation, add a design file).
- Commit your changes with clear, concise messages.
- Push your branch to your forked repository.
- Open a Pull Request from your branch to the main branch of the main Cyberlimb repository.
- Ensure your PR description clearly explains the changes you've made and why.

### Getting Started (Contribution Workflow)

For those ready to dive in and contribute directly, here's a general workflow to guide your efforts:

* **Code of Conduct:** To ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone, we ask all contributors to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before contributing.
