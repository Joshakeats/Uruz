## The Uruz Ethic

Uruz is not merely an exoskeletal system—it is a vessel of intention. Its design reflects the belief that strength is only noble when guided by purpose, and power is only safe when filtered through will.

## The Rule of Three

Just as the body balances left and right through the spine, and decisions balance instinct and caution through awareness—Uruz follows a tripartite control model:
- **Impulse**
- **Confirmation**
- **Fulcrum**

This mirrors nature’s most stable systems. It echoes ancient myth, the scales of Libra, the runes of man and force and shield.

## The Golden Ratio

The form of Uruz is derived not from symmetry, but from *proportional tension*. Like the spiral of a galaxy or the reach of a fern, its strength lies in imbalance that resolves into harmony.

## Rune as Ratio

Each Uruz module incorporates runic geometry that follows principles of both physics and archetype:
- **Uruz**: the arc of strength
- **Madhr**: the center of self
- **Thurz**: the arc of decisive energy, never enclosing, but embracing

Together, these do not form a circuit. They form a system in dynamic rest.

Point 1: Signal (instinct, neural spark)

Point 2: Confirmation (gesture, co-contract, subvocal)

Point 3: Context / Fulcrum (the AI, environment, the “balance”)

You could briefly describe how:

Uruz forms the frame

Madhr rises within as the center of humanity

Thurz arcs around as protective power, not dominance
