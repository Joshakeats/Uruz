 1. Medical Use Case: ALS / Tourette’s / Stroke Recovery
🎯 Scenario:
A user with a progressive neuromotor condition is using Uruz_01 to assist in walking and balance. Muscle tremors and false-start neural spikes are common.

🛡️ Uruz Behavior:
Primary motor signal fires: slight foot twitch.

No co-contract confirmation or subvocal echo → action halted.

AI logs event, adjusts threshold sensitivity slightly down.

Emotional context: mild frustration, but not panic → system remains passive.

🧠 Result: No false step. No embarrassment. No injury.
System listens, waits for real intention. The user remains in command.

🚨 2. Emergency Interventions / Combat Application
🎯 Scenario:
The user is in a high-stress situation. Heart rate spikes. Surroundings are chaotic. The user intends to strike or dodge reflexively—but there's a 10% chance the signal is panic-driven.

🛡️ Uruz Behavior:
Primary motor spike + microgesture matches normal strike pattern

AI detects elevated cortisol/stress pattern

Fulcrum layer activates: a 100ms microdelay introduced

Emotional override module confirms it’s not a flinch or fear impulse

🧠 Result: Strike is executed only if it's confirmed as intent—not fear.
Reflexes are preserved, but not hijacked by panic. The system trusts but verifies.

⚙️ 3. Performance Augmentation (Industrial / Space Ops)
🎯 Scenario:
User is in zero-G, using Uruz limbs to navigate delicate equipment during maintenance outside a station. Any slip or twitch could send them spinning.

🛡️ Uruz Behavior:
Subvocal command: "Hold"

Primary muscle command fires: push

No co-activation. Emotional state: calm

AI vetoes push. Logs the misfire for adaptive training

🧠 Result: No motion. No risk. User remains in full control.
Uruz differentiates between thought and readiness.

🔧 Systemic Summary: Uruz Regulation Stack in Action
Layer	Purpose	Trigger Example	Response
Signal Capture	Detect raw intent	Neural spike	Log & wait
Confirmation	Confirm will	Co-contract or subvocal echo	Arm “ready”
Fulcrum	Assess context	Panic, fatigue, unfamiliar signal	Pass, delay, or cancel
Execution	Perform task	All green lights	Move
