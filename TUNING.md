 The Tuning Phase (Neural-Muscular Calibration Protocol)
Before Uruz reaches operational trust, it must learn how its user movesâ€”and wants to move. The human mind is plastic. The system is adaptive. Together, they enter a mutual resonance phase.

Like strings adjusting to one another, system and self must find their shared note.

Key Elements:
Guided Calibration Routines: Slow movements, repeated gestures, co-contractions

Real-Time Feedback Loops: Haptic or audio cues when signal and action align

Adaptive AI Listening: System begins to "hear" false positives vs intended motion

Emotional Neutrality Zones: Calibrations run in low-stress, consistent environments

"Uruz does not assume it knows you. It listens. It tunes itself to your will."
